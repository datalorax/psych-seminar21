# Different ways of encoding data

```{r data-encoding, fig.width = 14}
plot_grid(aes_pos, aes_shape, aes_size,
          aes_color, aes_lwd, aes_ltp,
          ncol = 3,
          labels = c("position", "shape", "size", "color", "line width", "line type"),
          label_x = 0.05, label_y = 0.95, hjust = 0, vjust = 1, 
          label_size = 40)
```

---
# Other elements to consider
* Text
  
  + How is the text displayed (e.g., font, face, location)? 
  
  + What is the purpose of the text?

--

* Transparency
  
  + Are there overlapping pieces? 
  
  + Can transparency help?

---
# Other elements to consider
* Type of data

  + Continuous/categorical

  + Which can be mapped to each aesthetic?

    - e.g., shape and line type can only be mapped to categorical data, whereas
    color and size can be mapped to either.

# Alternative representation

# Comparison

* Both represent three scales

  + Two position scales (x/y axis)
  + One color scale (categorical for the first, continuous for the second)

# More scales are possible

```{r five-scales}

# Common problems 
### Too many colors

More than 5-ish generally becomes difficult to track

```{r too-many-colors}
theme_set(theme_minimal(20))
ggplot(popgrowth_df, aes(pop2000, popgrowth, color = state)) +
  geom_point()
```

---
# Use labels

still too many...

```{r states-labeled}
library(ggrepel) #<<

ggplot(popgrowth_df, aes(pop2000, popgrowth)) +
  geom_point(color = "gray70") +
  geom_text_repel(aes(label = state)) #<<
```

---
# Better

Get a subset

```{r subset-states}
to_label <- c("Alaska", "Arizona", "California", "Florida", "Wisconsin", 
              "Louisiana", "Nevada", "Michigan", "Montana", "New Mexico", 
              "Pennsylvania", "New York", "Oregon", "Rhode Island",
              "Tennessee", "Texas", "Utah", "Vermont")
subset_states <- popgrowth_df %>%
  filter(state %in% to_label)

ggplot(popgrowth_df, aes(pop2000, popgrowth)) +
  geom_point(color = "gray70") +
  geom_text_repel(aes(label = state), data = subset_states) 
```

---
# Best
(but could still be improved)

```{r best-label}
ggplot(popgrowth_df, aes(pop2000, popgrowth)) +
  geom_point(color = "gray70") +
  geom_point(color = "#DC5265", data = subset_states) +
  geom_text_repel(aes(label = state), 
                  data = subset_states,
                  min.segment.length = 0,
                  box.padding = 0.5,
                  color = "gray40") 
```

---
# Problem w/ default palette 
### For {ggplot2}
```{r colorblind1, echo = FALSE, fig.height = 8}
p <- ggplot(popgrowth_df, 
       aes(x = state, 
           y = 100*popgrowth)) + 
  geom_col(aes(fill = region),
           alpha = 0.7) + 
  coord_flip() +
  theme_void()
colorblindr::cvd_grid(p)
```

---
# Alternative: viridis

```{r viridis1, fig.height = 8.25}
ggplot(popgrowth_df, 
       aes(x = state, 
           y = 100*popgrowth)) + 
  geom_col(aes(fill = region),
           alpha = 0.7) + 
  scale_y_continuous(expand = c(0, 0)) +
  scale_fill_viridis_d() + 
  coord_flip() +
  theme_minimal(12)
```

---
# Revised version

```{r echo = FALSE, fig.height = 8}
p2 <- ggplot(popgrowth_df, 
       aes(x = state, 
           y = 100*popgrowth)) + 
  geom_col(aes(fill = region),
           alpha = 0.7) +

# Data ink ratio

---
# What is it?

--
> ### Above all else,  show the data

<br>
\-Edward Tufte


--
* Data-Ink Ratio = Ink devoted to the data / total ink used to produce the
figure


--
* Common goal: Maximize the data-ink ratio

---
# Example

![](img/six-boxplots.png)

--

* First thought might be... Cool!

---
# Minimize cognitive load
* Empirically, Tufte's plot was .bolder[the most difficult] for viewers to
interpret.


--
* Visual cues (labels, gridlines) reduce the data-ink ratio, but can also 
reduce cognitive load.

# Advice from Wilke

> Whenever possible, **visualize your data with solid, colored shapes** rather than with lines that outline those shapes. Solid shapes are more easily perceived, are less likely to create visual artifacts or optical illusions, and do more immediately convey amounts than do outlines.

# Not always a bad thing
> It is tempting to lay down inflexible rules about what to do in terms of producing your graphs, and to dismiss people who don’t follow them as producing junk charts or lying with statistics. But being honest with your data is a bigger problem than can be solved by rules of thumb about making graphs. In this case there is a moderate level of agreement that bar charts should generally include a zero baseline (or equivalent) given that bars encode their variables as lengths. But it would be a mistake to think that a dot plot was by the same token deliberately misleading, just because it kept itself to the range of the data instead.

# Conclusions 

## Practical takeaways to make better visualizations

---
1. Avoid line drawings

2. Sort bar charts in ascending/descending order as long as the other axis does not have implicit meaning

3. Consider dropping legends and using annotations, when possible

4. Use color to your advantage, but be sensitive to color-blindness, and use the right kind of palette

5. Consider double-encoding data (shapes and color)

6. Make your labels bigger! .gray[Didn't talk about this one much but it's super common and really important]



---
# Some things to avoid

* Essentially never

  + Use dual axes (produce separate plots instead)

  + Use 3D unnecessarily

* Be wary of

  + Truncated axes

  + Pie charts (particularly with lots of categories)
